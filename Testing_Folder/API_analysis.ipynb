    "Usually there are 9 players, so there would be 9 times 283 features only to account for past season statistics of 1 team. So this number would be later mulitply also by 2 since each game involves 2 teams. We will use **schedule_and_record()** function to get the players who played in a game, so we can later use **batting_stats()** function to get those 283 features from last season for each player that played a particular game.\n",
